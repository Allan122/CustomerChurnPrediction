# CustomerChurnPrediction

Customer attrition also known as customer churn or customer defection, refers to the loss of customers or clients by a business over a certain period of time. It occurs when customers stop purchasing products or services from a company, discontinue their subscriptions or switch to competitors. It's crucial for the company to look after reasons why customers are leaving and should take steps to reduce the number of customers leaving.

I have build a basic model for predicting customer churn using Customer_Churn.csv file/dataset. We are using some classification algorithm to model customers who have left, using Python tools such as pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualisations.
